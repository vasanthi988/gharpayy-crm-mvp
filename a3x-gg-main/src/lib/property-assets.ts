/**
 * Property assets registry — connects each PG to its Drive PDF brochure.
 *
 * The shared Drive folder lives at:
 *   https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18xJ5LrEiAL8b9BkXGQztKr-w2qdZey2Q
 *
 * Without OAuth/Drive API we cannot fetch a stable per-file URL programmatically,
 * so this module:
 *   1. Holds a hand-curated map of `pgId` → direct Drive file URL (when known).
 *   2. Falls back to a Drive "search inside this folder" URL for the PG name,
 *      which lands the rep on the right brochure in one click.
 *   3. Exposes helpers to build WhatsApp-ready messages that include the PDF
 *      link so a TCM can ship the brochure to a customer in two taps.
 *
 * To add a new direct link, paste the Drive file's "Anyone with the link can
 * view" URL into PROPERTY_PDF_DIRECT below.
